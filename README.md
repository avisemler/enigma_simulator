# enigma_simulator

Currently, main.py implements a military 3-wheel enigma.

The entry wheel matches up each letters with physical positions in a straightforward way (i.e. "a" gets sent to the first location, "b" to the second, etc.), unlike a naval engima, which uses the QWERTZ order.

Ringstellung is not implemented.
